**ChatGPT:**

Thank you for sharing the configuration

* * *

**You:**

i would like to manage the VLANs only on the layer 3 switch (3560-PS) what will i have to change in the configurations?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you want to manage the VLANs only on a Layer 3 switch (like the Cisco 3560-PS), you will have to make a few changes to your configurations.

First, you need to make sure that the Layer 3 switch has all the VLANs configured that you want to manage. If you don't already have the VLANs configured on the switch, you would add them with a command like:

```bash
vlan 10
name Company-VLAN
exit
vlan 20
name Security-VLAN
exit
vlan 30
name Public-VLAN
exit
vlan 40
name Printer-VLAN
exit
```

Second, you need to ensure that the Layer 3 switch has an interface in each VLAN. This interface is often called a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI), and it's what the switch uses to route traffic between VLANs. If you don't already have these interfaces configured, you would add them with a command like:

```bash
interface vlan 10
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface vlan 20
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface vlan 30
ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
exit
interface vlan 40
ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
exit
```

You will also need to make sure that the interfaces connected to the other switches (or devices) are configured as trunk ports to allow multiple VLANs to pass through. This appears to already be the case in the configuration you provided.

On the Layer 2 switch (like the Cisco 2950 in your configuration), you don't need to have any VLAN interfaces configured. Instead, all you need is for the ports connected to the Layer 3 switch to be configured as trunk ports. You also need to make sure that the ports connected to end devices are configured with the correct access VLAN.

Please note that your original configurations do not include a Layer 3 switch configuration. The provided configurations were for a router (VivaRouter) and a Layer 2 switch (VivaSwitch). If you have the Layer 3 switch configuration and want me to review it, feel free to provide it.

* * *

**You:**

what will i have to change for the subinterfaces on the router? if i move everything to the switch?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're moving the VLAN management to a Layer 3 switch, you won't need the subinterfaces on the router. You can remove these subinterfaces.

The current configuration of the router, `VivaRouter`, has subinterfaces for VLAN 10, 20, 30, and 40 on the `GigabitEthernet0/0` interface. These subinterfaces are set up for inter-VLAN routing, but if you're moving this function to the Layer 3 switch, you can delete these subinterfaces.

You can remove a subinterface using the `no interface` command. For example:

```bash
no interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10
no interface GigabitEthernet0/0.20
no interface GigabitEthernet0/0.30
no interface GigabitEthernet0/0.40
```

You can then configure the `GigabitEthernet0/0` interface as a regular interface that will connect to the Layer 3 switch:

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address <ip-address> <subnet-mask>
```

Remember to replace `<ip-address>` and `<subnet-mask>` with appropriate values based on your network design.

Please note, if you have any specific routing, NAT or ACL settings tied to these sub-interfaces, you will need to revisit and adjust these configurations accordingly.

Also, after moving the VLAN management to the Layer 3 switch, you will need to configure Inter-VLAN routing on the switch, if not done already.

* * *

**You:**

will i have to set a gateway for the vlan interfaces?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, each VLAN interface on the Layer 3 switch should have an IP address configured, which will act as the default gateway for devices within that VLAN.

When you configure an IP address on a VLAN interface (Switch Virtual Interface - SVI), that IP address becomes the default gateway for the devices in that VLAN. The hosts in the VLAN use this IP address as their default gateway, and the Layer 3 switch routes the traffic between different VLANs.

Here's how you would configure it:

```bash
interface Vlan10
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface Vlan20
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface Vlan30
ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface Vlan40
ip address 192.168.40.1 255.255.255.0
exit
```

In the above example, for devices in VLAN 10, their default gateway would be 192.168.10.1; for devices in VLAN 20, their default gateway would be 192.168.20.1 and so on. You would need to ensure that these IP addresses are configured as the default gateways on the respective devices within each VLAN.

* * *

**You:**

the default used VLAN should be 10 and how will i connect the router to this? and allow all vlans to commuicate outside?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're moving VLAN management to the Layer 3 switch and you want all VLANs to communicate with the outside world, the router will still have a role in providing access to external networks.

Here is how you might set this up:

1.  Connect the router to the Layer 3 switch: You would typically do this by connecting a port on the router to a port on the Layer 3 switch. This port on the switch should be configured as a trunk port to allow traffic from all VLANs. For example:
    
    ```bash
    interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
    switchport mode trunk
    ```
    
    In this example, `GigabitEthernet0/1` is the interface on the switch that is connected to the router.
    
2.  Configure the corresponding interface on the router: The interface on the router that is connected to the Layer 3 switch should be given an IP address in the same subnet as the VLAN 10 interface on the switch. This will be the default gateway for the Layer 3 switch. For example:
    
    ```bash
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0
    ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0
    ```
    
    In this example, `192.168.10.2` is the IP address of the router interface connected to the switch, and it's in the same subnet as the VLAN 10 interface on the switch (`192.168.10.1`).
    
3.  Set the default gateway on the switch: Configure the Layer 3 switch to use the router as its default gateway. This will allow it to send traffic to external networks.
    
    ```bash
    ip default-gateway 192.168.10.2
    ```
    
4.  Set up routing on the router: The router needs to know how to route traffic back to the VLANs on the Layer 3 switch. For this, you would add static routes on the router for each VLAN. For example:
    
    ```bash
    ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1
    ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1
    ip route 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.10.1
    ```
    
    Each of these commands tells the router how to get to a different VLAN on the switch.
    
5.  Configure NAT on the router: If you want the devices on the VLANs to be able to access the Internet, you'll need to configure Network Address Translation (NAT) on the router. This will allow the devices on the VLANs to share the router's public IP address. For example:
    
    ```bash
    ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/0 overload
    access-list 1 permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
    access-list 1 permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
    access-list 1 permit 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255
    access-list 1 permit 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
    ```
    
    This configuration allows devices in each VLAN to share the public IP address of `GigabitEthernet0/0` when accessing the Internet.
    

Please replace the example interface names and IP addresses with those that match your actual network configuration.

if i try to ping the router from a laptop connected to a switch ill revive the following error in the PDU messag.

GigabitEthernet0/1 is blocked by STP. The device drops the frame

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The error message you are seeing, "GigabitEthernet0/1 is blocked by STP. The device drops the frame," is due to the operation of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP).

STP is a network protocol designed to prevent loops in a network topology. It does this by designating some paths in the network as blocked. If a port is blocked by STP, it means that STP has determined that there's another, better path for the traffic to take, and has blocked this port to prevent a loop.

There are a few possible reasons why you might be seeing this message:

1.  There is a loop in your network: If STP has blocked a port, it might be because there's a loop in your network topology. If this is the case, you should review your network design and remove any loops.
    
2.  There is a problem with your STP configuration: It's possible that the STP configuration on your devices is incorrect, causing STP to block a port that it shouldn't. You should review the STP configuration on your devices to make sure it's correct.
    
3.  There is a problem with the physical connection: If there's a problem with the physical connection between the devices (for example, a faulty cable or a loose connection), STP might block the port because it can't establish a stable link. You should check the physical connections between your devices to make sure they're secure.
    

If the above possibilities are not the issue, another possible solution is to adjust the STP priorities to ensure that the
