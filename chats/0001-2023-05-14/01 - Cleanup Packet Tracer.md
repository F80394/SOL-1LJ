**You:**

i got 2 networks, that from my company and a simulated web inside packet tracer. 

If i trie to ping, the server can reach the web but the internet cannot respond. 

can u try to find the error? its at layer 3 with following message:
1. The packet is coming from an outside network. The device looks up its NAT table for necessary translations.
2. The NAT table does not have a matched entry for this packet. It passes the packet through without translations.
3. The device looks up the destination IP address in the routing table.

**ChatGPT:**

Based on the configuration provided, I can see that you have configured NAT on the Company Router, but the NAT rule is missing on the Internet router. This is causing the issue where the server can reach the web but the internet cannot respond.

To fix this issue, you need to configure NAT on the Internet router. Here's how you can do that:

1.  Add an access-list to define the local IP addresses that need translation on the Internet router:

```
ip access-list standard NAT_ACL
 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255
```

2.  Configure the NAT rule on the Internet router:

```kotlin
ip nat inside source list NAT_ACL interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
```

Here's the updated configuration for the Internet router:

```diff
!
version 15.1
no service timestamps log datetime msec
no service timestamps debug datetime msec
no service password-encryption
!
hostname Internet
!
!
!
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.10
!
ip dhcp pool Internet_A
```

* * *

**You:**

how can i fix that if im not allowed to change the internet router?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you're not allowed to change the configuration on the Internet router, you can perform NAT on the Company Router to translate the internal IP addresses to the public IP address assigned to the GigabitEthernet0/1 interface of the Company Router.

To do this, you can follow these steps:

1.  Remove the existing NAT configuration from the Company Router:

```kotlin
no ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
```

2.  Create an access-list on the Company Router to define the local IP addresses that need translation:

```
ip access-list standard NAT_ACL
 permit 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255
 permit 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255
 permit 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255
```

3.  Configure the NAT rule on the Company Router to perform the translation:

```kotlin
ip nat inside source list NAT_ACL interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
```

In this updated configuration, I have removed unnecessary commands and ensured that the switchports are properly configured for their respective VLANs. The switchports connected to the router are configured as trunk ports (GigabitEthernet0/1 and GigabitEthernet0/2) to allow traffic from multiple VLANs to pass through.

Please note that I didn't see a VLAN 40 in the Company Router configuration, so you might want to double-check if the VLAN 40 configuration on interface FastEthernet0/3 is intentional or should be adjusted.

**You:**

Now, the ports are configured as follows:

*   Ports FastEthernet0/1 to FastEthernet0/15 are assigned to the Company VLAN (VLAN 10).
*   Ports FastEthernet0/16 to FastEthernet0/20 are assigned to the Security VLAN (VLAN 20).
*   Ports FastEthernet0/21 to FastEthernet0/24 are assigned to the Public VLAN (VLAN 30).

The two GigabitEthernet ports (GigabitEthernet0/1 and GigabitEthernet0/2) are still configured as trunk ports.

* * *

**You:**

is the trunk encapsulation dot1q from the switch config compatible with the router settings if i connect the router to port gig0/1 of the switch

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, the trunk encapsulation dot1q configuration on the switch is compatible with the router settings.

In the router configuration, you have subinterfaces configured on GigabitEthernet0/0 with dot1Q encapsulation for VLANs 10, 20, and 30:

```kotlin
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ...
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.20
 encapsulation dot1Q 20
 ...
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.30
 encapsulation dot1Q 30
 ...
```

On the switch, the GigabitEthernet0/1 interface is configured as a trunk port with dot1Q encapsulation:

```kotlin
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
```

These configurations are compatible. When you connect the router's GigabitEthernet0/0 interface to the switch's GigabitEthernet0/1 port, the router and the switch will be able to exchange traffic for VLANs 10, 20, and 30 over the trunk link.

* * *

**You:**

will i have to set the Fa0/1 Port to Trunk on the switch if the DNS server will be  used by all VLANs that is connected on that port?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If the DNS server is connected to the FastEthernet0/1 port on the switch and you want it to be accessible by all VLANs, you don't need to set the Fa0/1 port to trunk mode. Instead, you can configure the DNS server with an IP address from a specific VLAN (e.g., VLAN 10) and use inter-VLAN routing on the router to allow communication between VLANs.

To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Assign an IP address to the DNS server from the desired VLAN (e.g., VLAN 10). Ensure that the DNS server's default gateway is set to the router's IP address for that VLAN (e.g., 192.168.2.1).
    
2.  Enable inter-VLAN routing on the router. The router is already configured with subinterfaces for each VLAN, so it will route traffic between VLANs by default.
    
3.  Configure the access control lists (ACLs) on the router, if necessary, to allow the desired traffic flow between the VLANs and the DNS server.
    

With this configuration, the devices in all VLANs will be able to access the DNS server through the router, and you won't need to configure the Fa0/1 port as a trunk port on the switch.

**You:**

the package will fail while comming back from the simulated google server at the internet router, i think he does not know how to translate the IP. how can i provide this information without chaning the internet router itself?



* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Since you cannot modify the Internet router's configuration, you can use the Company router to perform NAT for your internal networks before sending the traffic to the Internet router. This way, the Internet router will receive packets with a source IP address it can understand and route back.

You have already configured NAT on the Company router, but you will need to adjust the access list to include all VLANs that need access to the internet:

Here's the updated NAT configuration for the Company router:

```typescript
ip nat inside source list 100 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
!
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
access-list 100 permit ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

This configuration allows devices in VLAN 10 (192.168.2.0/24), VLAN 20 (192.168.3.0/24), and VLAN 30 (192.168.100.0/24) to access the internet using NAT. The Company router will translate the internal IP addresses to its GigabitEthernet0/1 interface's IP address before forwarding the packets to the Internet router.

With these changes, devices in all VLANs should be able to communicate with the simulated Google server, and the response from the server should successfully reach the devices.

* * *

**You:**

ip nat inside source list 100 interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
can i just switch 100 with "NAT_ACL"?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can replace the access list number "100" with a named access list such as "NAT\_ACL". Here's how the updated configuration would look:

```typescript
ip nat inside source list NAT_ACL interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
!
ip access-list extended NAT_ACL
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

This configuration works the same way as the previous one using an access list number. It allows devices in VLAN 10 (192.168.2.0/24), VLAN 20 (192.168.3.0/24), and VLAN 30 (192.168.100.0/24) to access the internet using NAT. The Company router will translate the internal IP addresses to its GigabitEthernet0/1 interface's IP address before forwarding the packets to the Internet router.

Using a named access list like "NAT\_ACL" can be more descriptive and make it easier to understand the purpose of the access list in the configuration.

* * *

**You:**

won't i have to declare the VLan inside the router conig?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

My apologies for the confusion. In my previous response, I mistakenly referred to the subinterfaces as being already configured on the Company router. Here's how you can configure the VLANs on the Company router:

1.  Configure subinterfaces for each VLAN on the router's GigabitEthernet0/0 interface:

```kotlin
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 no ip address
 duplex auto
 speed auto
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10
 description Company-VLAN
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ip address 192.168.2.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat inside
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.20
 description Security-VLAN
 encapsulation dot1Q 20
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat inside
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.30
 description Public-VLAN
 encapsulation dot1Q 30
 ip address 192.168.100.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat inside
```

2.  Configure the NAT\_ACL access list as mentioned in my previous response:

```typescript
ip nat inside source list NAT_ACL interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
!
ip access-list extended NAT_ACL
 permit ip 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 any
```

With these changes, the VLANs are declared inside the router configuration, and devices in all VLANs should be able to access the internet using NAT. The Company router will translate the internal IP addresses to its GigabitEthernet0/1 interface's IP address before forwarding the packets to the Internet router.

* * *

**You:**

how can i set a vlan name on the switch

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To set a VLAN name on the switch, use the following steps:

1.  Enter global configuration mode:

```
configure terminal
```

2.  Enter VLAN configuration mode for the specific VLAN you want to name:

```php-template
vlan <vlan_id>
```

Replace `<vlan_id>` with the VLAN number you want to configure. For example, to configure VLAN 10:

```
vlan 10
```

3.  Set the VLAN name using the `name` command:

```php-template
name <vlan_name>
```

Replace `<vlan_name>` with the desired name for the VLAN. For example, to name VLAN 10 "Company\_VLAN":

```
name Company_VLAN
```

4.  Exit VLAN configuration mode:

```bash
exit
```

5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for each VLAN you want to name.

Here's an example configuration for naming VLANs 10, 20, and 30:

```bash
configure terminal
vlan 10
name Company_VLAN
exit
vlan 20
name Security_VLAN
exit
vlan 30
name Public_VLAN
exit
```

These commands create and name the VLANs on the switch. Don't forget to save the configuration after making changes:

```arduino
write memory
```

To route DNS queries for unknown domains to an external DNS server, you need to configure the DNS server on your Server-PT with a forwarder. A forwarder is a DNS server to which your Server-PT sends DNS queries that it cannot resolve locally.

Here are the steps to configure a forwarder on your Server-PT's DNS server:

1.  Open the Server-PT configuration window.
    
2.  Click on the "Services" tab and select "DNS" from the list of services.
    
3.  Find the "Forwarders" section in the DNS configuration window.
    
4.  Add the external DNS server's IP address (for example, Google's public DNS server 8.8.8.8) to the list of forwarders.
    
5.  Save the configuration.
    

Now, whenever your Server-PT DNS server receives a DNS query for a domain it doesn't have information about, it will forward the query to the specified external DNS server (8.8.8.8 in this example).

Make sure your internal network devices are configured to use your Server-PT's DNS server as their primary DNS server. Also, ensure that your network devices have the correct default gateway configured so they can reach the external DNS server when needed. In this case, the default gateway should be the Company router's IP address in each VLAN:

*   VLAN 10: 192.168.2.1
*   VLAN 20: 192.168.3.1
*   VLAN 30: 192.168.100.1

**You:**

my server pt only allows records for: A, AAAA, CName, NS, SOA
can i configure it on the managed switch? (u got the config vivaSwitch)

Apologies for the confusion. It seems that the Server-PT you are using does not support DNS forwarding directly. In this case, you can configure the clients to use the external DNS server as their secondary DNS server. This way, if the primary DNS server (Server-PT) fails to resolve a query, the clients will automatically use the secondary DNS server to resolve the query.

To do this, you will need to configure the DHCP server on your Server-PT to provide the external DNS server's IP address as the secondary DNS server.

However, you mentioned that you want to configure this on the managed switch. Unfortunately, you cannot configure DNS forwarding on the switch itself, as the VivaSwitch configuration you provided is a Layer 2 switch and does not handle DNS or DHCP functionality.

Your best option in this case is to configure the clients to use an external DNS server as their secondary DNS server. If you are using a DHCP server on your network, update the DHCP server configuration to provide the external DNS server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8) as the secondary DNS server. Clients will then use the secondary DNS server if the primary DNS server (Server-PT) cannot resolve a query.

If you are configuring the clients manually, you can directly set the secondary DNS server on each client to the external DNS server's IP address.

**You:**

u cannot set a secondary dns on dhcp service of a server-pt can i somehoe configure it to go tho the router when the dns server does not have a entry?

Apologies for the misunderstanding earlier. Unfortunately, as you mentioned, the Server-PT DHCP service does not support providing a secondary DNS server. In this case, you can use a workaround by configuring the clients to use the router as their DNS server and then configure the router to forward DNS queries to both the Server-PT and the external DNS server.

Here's how you can configure the router to forward DNS queries:

1.  Enable DNS service on the router:

```
configure terminal
ip dns server
```

2.  Configure the router to forward DNS queries to the Server-PT and an external DNS server, for example, 8.8.8.8:

```arduino
ip name-server <Server-PT_IP> 8.8.8.8
```

Replace `<Server-PT_IP>` with the actual IP address of your Server-PT DNS server.

3.  Configure the DHCP server on your Server-PT to provide the router's IP address as the primary DNS server for each VLAN:

*   VLAN 10: 192.168.2.1
*   VLAN 20: 192.168.3.1
*   VLAN 30: 192.168.100.1

Now, when a client sends a DNS query to the router, the router will forward the query to both the Server-PT and the external DNS server (8.8.8.8). The router will use the first response it receives and ignore the other response. This way, if the Server-PT does not have an entry for a domain, the external DNS server will resolve the query, and the router will return the result to the client.

Keep in mind that this solution might slightly increase the DNS resolution time for clients as the router will be forwarding queries to both the Server-PT and the external DNS server, but it should be a suitable workaround for your requirements.

can i add the server pt as preffered host?

Unfortunately, the Server-PT DHCP service does not support the configuration of a preferred DNS server. However, you can manually configure each client on your network to use the Server-PT as their preferred (primary) DNS server and the external DNS server as their secondary DNS server.

Here's how you can do this on Windows
