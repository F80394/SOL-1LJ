**ChatGPT:**

Okay, I've processed the Layer 3 switch configuration you've provided. This is a configuration of a Layer 3

* * *

**You:**

i cannot ping from any devices to the router or devices connected to it.

i know there has to be a missconfiguration. maybe also multiple missconfigurations.

What the network should be is the following:
A Router as main entry point to the network, with NAT entries to translate inside &amp; outside communication, then on the switch VLAN configuration which allows for extra security inside the company network. 

if there are any thinks unclear ask

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Based on the configuration you've shared and your network description, I can make a few observations:

1. The Router:
    
    * The router `VivaRouter` has an IP address of `192.168.2.1` on its `GigabitEthernet0/0` interface.
    * It's attempting to use NAT with an ACL `NAT_ACL` which includes IP ranges from `192.168.10.0` to `192.168.40.0` but its own interface is on a different subnet (`192.168.2.0`).
2. The Layer 3 Switch:
    
    * The Layer 3 switch `VivaSwitch` has multiple VLAN interfaces (10, 20, 30, 40) each with its own subnet (respectively, `192.168.10.0`, `192.168.20.0`, `192.168.30.0`, and `192.168.40.0`).
    * The switchports are correctly associated with their VLANs and the trunk ports are allowing the correct VLANs.
    * There are IP helper-address entries pointing to `192.168.10.10`, presumably a DHCP server.

Here are the issues I observe:

1. Subnet Mismatch:
    
    * The router is configured on a separate subnet (`192.168.2.0`) than the VLAN interfaces on the switch (`192.168.10.0`, `192.168.20.0`, `192.168.30.0`, `192.168.40.0`).
    * Devices on these VLANs cannot directly communicate with the router because they are not on the same network.
2. Missing Routing Protocol or Static Routes:
    
    * From the configurations, it appears there is no routing protocol set up on the switch to allow it to share its VLAN interfaces' network routes with the router. This could be resolved by using OSPF or EIGRP to propagate these routes.
    * Alternatively, you could set up static routes on the router to allow it to know where to send traffic for those specific VLAN networks.

To fix the issue:

1. Subnet Mismatch: Consider assigning the Router's `GigabitEthernet0/0` interface an IP address in one of the subnets defined in the switch VLANs. For instance, you could put the router on the `192.168.10.0` subnet, then ensure your NAT ACLs and other configurations match this network.
    
2. Missing Routing Protocol or Static Routes: Implement a routing protocol like OSPF or EIGRP on both the switch and router to share network routes. Or add static routes on the router for each VLAN network on the switch, pointing to the switch's IP address in that VLAN as the next hop.
    

Also, check for any possible physical connectivity issues if the configurations don't seem to be the cause of the problem.

* * *

**You:**

can u atempt to fix the configs?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, I'll attempt to adjust the configurations for both the router and the Layer 3 switch based on the observations made. The goal is to align them better with the stated network layout. Note that these configurations may need further adjustment based on the specific needs and layout of your actual network.

**You:**

how should the dhcp pools be configured based on this settings?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Based on the configurations and network layout you've described, you might want to create four DHCP pools on your router - one for each VLAN. Each pool will have a range of addresses that it can assign within its respective subnet.

Here is an example of what the DHCP pool configurations might look like on your router:

```bash
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.10    # Reserve the first 10 addresses for static assignment
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.20.1 192.168.20.10
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.30.1 192.168.30.10
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.40.1 192.168.40.10

ip dhcp pool VLAN10
 network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.10.1
 dns-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

ip dhcp pool VLAN20
 network 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.20.2
 dns-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

ip dhcp pool VLAN30
 network 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.30.2
 dns-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

ip dhcp pool VLAN40
 network 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 192.168.40.2
 dns-server 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

Each pool is set up for a specific network (matching the VLAN networks) with a range of IP addresses it can distribute. The `default-router` command sets the default gateway for each network, and the `dns-server` command provides the IP addresses of the DNS servers to the DHCP clients (in this case, Google's public DNS servers are used as an example).

The `ip dhcp excluded-address` command is used to prevent the DHCP server from distributing certain IP addresses within the specified range, which is useful for devices with statically assigned IP addresses. In this case, the first 10 addresses of each network are reserved for such devices.

Please note that these are example configurations, and you should adjust them as needed to fit your specific requirements and network design. The DNS server addresses, for example, should be replaced with the addresses of your actual DNS servers.

**You:**

how would i typically configure vlans? if i want to have 4 vlans in my company network. 10,20,30,40
10 &amp; 30 should be able to access to internet, while 20 &amp; 40 are encapulated and cannot reach outside.
can u give the basic packet tracer config. keep in mind to perform nat routing. also each vlan should have its own ip set it where needed

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, I can provide a basic configuration example for the Cisco Router and Switch to create and manage 4 VLANs: 10, 20, 30, and 40. You mentioned that VLANs 10 and 30 should have internet access and VLANs 20 and 40 should be encapsulated and not have outside access.

Please note that this is an example configuration and might require some adjustments based on your network specifics.

```

The configurations provided will set up VLANs 10 and 30 with NAT on the router, allowing devices on these VLANs to reach the internet. VLANs 20 and 40 will be encapsulated and won't have NAT, meaning they won't be able to reach the outside network. Please make sure that the physical connections between your router and switch are correctly configured.

These are basic configurations and don't include any specific security measures, which would typically be necessary in a real-world network. Also, DHCP service is not set up in this configuration, so you'll need to assign IP addresses manually or configure a DHCP service.

This also assumes your router supports creating sub-interfaces for each VLAN (i.e., router-on-a-stick configuration), which is why I've set up `interface GigabitEthernet0/0.30` in the router config. If your router doesn't support this, you'll need to have a separate physical interface for each VLAN.

Please review these configurations and adjust them to meet your specific needs. Always test configurations in a controlled environment before deploying to a live network.

* * *

**You:**

will i have to allow inter vlan configuration on the switch or the router? can u provide a example? allowing every vlan to send and recive from vlan 40, allowing only vlan 10 to communicate with vlan 20 and only allowing communication between 10 and 30


* * *

**ChatGPT:**

To allow certain VLANs to communicate with each other while restricting others, you would typically use Access Control Lists (ACLs) on your router. This can also be done on a Layer 3 switch, but in your case, where the router is performing inter-VLAN routing, it is best to implement it on the router.

Here's an example of how you could implement this based on your requirements:

```bash
!
ip access-list extended ACL_VLANs
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
!
```

After creating the access list, you can apply it to the appropriate interfaces on the router:

```bash
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip access-group ACL_VLANs in
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.30
 ip access-group ACL_VLANs in
!
```

In this configuration:

* All VLANs (10, 20, 30) can send to and receive from VLAN 40.
* Only VLAN 10 can communicate with VLAN 20.
* Only VLAN 10 can communicate with VLAN 30.

All other inter-VLAN traffic is denied.

Again, this is a simplified example and might need further customization based on your exact requirements. Please test in a controlled environment before applying to a live network. Also, keep in mind that applying ACLs can impact network performance and should be carefully planned and monitored.

**You:**

this is the response when i try to ping 8.8.8.8 (outside) from a device in vlan20 

C:\&gt;ping 8.8.8.8

Pinging 8.8.8.8 with 32 bytes of data:

Reply from 192.168.20.1: Destination host unreachable.
Reply from 192.168.20.1: Destination host unreachable.
Reply from 192.168.20.1: Destination host unreachable.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The "Destination host unreachable" message suggests that your device in VLAN 20 doesn't have a valid path to reach the 8.8.8.8 address. Since you've mentioned in your previous posts that VLANs 20 and 40 should not have access to the Internet, this is the expected behavior.

The reply is coming from the default gateway (192.168.20.1) which is probably the router's sub-interface for VLAN 20. This indicates that the router is correctly identifying that there's no valid route for the traffic from this VLAN to the Internet.

However, if you actually want to allow VLAN 20 to access the Internet, you will need to:

1. Add an NAT rule for VLAN 20 on your router:
    
    ```bash
    ip nat inside source list NAT_ACL interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
    ip access-list standard NAT_ACL
     permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
    ```
    
2. Configure the router's sub-interface for VLAN 20 with `ip nat inside`.
    

Remember, changes to network configurations should be done carefully and preferably in a controlled test environment before applying to a live network.

* * *

**You:**

may this access list be the problem? its enabled on all subinterfaces

ip access-list extended ACL_VLANs
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The ACL (Access Control List) you have posted is indeed limiting the network traffic. Based on its current configuration:

* VLAN 10 can communicate with VLANs 20, 30, and 40.
* VLAN 20 can communicate with VLAN 40.
* VLAN 30 can communicate with VLAN 40.

The `deny ip any any` line at the end of the ACL is denying all other traffic that isn't explicitly permitted by the preceding lines. This includes traffic to and from the Internet for VLANs 20, 30, and 40. So yes, this could be the cause of your issue.

If you want VLANs 20 and 40 to be isolated from the Internet but still want them to communicate with VLAN 40, you should keep the current configuration. However, if you want these VLANs to have Internet access, you would need to modify your ACL and NAT configuration accordingly.

Remember that making changes to network configuration, especially ACLs and NAT rules, can have a significant impact on network functionality and should be done with care and thorough testing.

* * *

**You:**

can u provide a example updated config, to allow vlan 10, 30 to access to internet

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Sure. In order to allow VLAN 10 and 30 to access the internet, you need to include them in your NAT configuration and adjust the ACL accordingly.

Here's an example:

```bash
!
ip nat inside source list NAT_ACL interface GigabitEthernet0/1 overload
!
ip access-list extended NAT_ACL
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any
 permit ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 any
!
```

Here, I've updated the ACL named `NAT_ACL` to include the IP ranges of VLANs 10 and 30. This allows any traffic from these IP ranges to be NATed and therefore access the internet.

You also need to make sure that the sub-interfaces for VLANs 10 and 30 are configured with `ip nat inside` to ensure that they're included in the NAT process. Here's an example for VLAN 10:

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.10
 encapsulation dot1q 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 ip nat inside
!
```

You'd do something similar for VLAN 30.

Remember, changes to network configurations should be done carefully and preferably in a controlled test environment before applying to a live network.

* * *

**You:**

ty for your help. this solved the problem. now lets create two access lists for vlan 20 and 40, so we can manage what they are able to access.

vlan 20 is the security vlan, it has no internet acces and should only accept connections from vlan 10, if possible only from ip 192.168.10.10.
vlan 40 is the printer vlan, it does not have internet access and should allow communication from all vlans since everyone should be able to print

Glad to hear that the previous advice was helpful. Now, for implementing the access control you've described, we'll need to modify and create some Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the router.

Let's create ACLs based on your requirements:

1. **VLAN 20 (Security VLAN)**: This VLAN should only accept connections from 192.168.10.10 (presumably, your security server) from VLAN 10.

```bash
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN20
 permit ip host 192.168.10.10 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```

2. **VLAN 40 (Printer VLAN)**: This VLAN should accept connections from all other VLANs.

```bash
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN40
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.40.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```

After creating these access lists, you'll need to apply them to the corresponding sub-interfaces on the router:

```bash
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.20
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN20 in
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0.40
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN40 in
```

Remember, any changes to network configurations should be done carefully and preferably in a controlled test environment before applying to a live network. Please thoroughly test these rules before implementing them.

**You:**

lets just simulate a firewall by basic acls on the router.

to make it simple i created a INSIDE and OUTSIDE acl for each subinterface

ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_INSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN20_INSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN20_OUTSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN30_INSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN30_OUTSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN40_INSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN40_OUTSIDE
 deny ip any any


now lets extend this basic configuration to allow 8.8.8.8 in &amp; out


* * *

**ChatGPT:**

If you want to allow traffic to and from 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS server), you need to modify your access-lists to permit IP traffic to and from that host. Here's an example of how you could modify the access lists for VLANs 10 and 30 to achieve this:

```arduino
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_INSIDE
 permit ip host 8.8.8.8 any
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE
 permit ip any host 8.8.8.8
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN20_INSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN20_OUTSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN30_INSIDE
 permit ip host 8.8.8.8 any
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN30_OUTSIDE
 permit ip any host 8.8.8.8
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN40_INSIDE
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN40_OUTSIDE
 deny ip any any
```

This configuration would permit devices in VLANs 10 and 30 to send traffic to 8.8.8.8 and receive responses. All other traffic is denied.

You would need to apply these access lists to the relevant interfaces in the in or out direction as required:

```kotlin
interface GigabitEthernet0/1.10
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN10_INSIDE in
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE out
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1.20
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN20_INSIDE in
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN20_OUTSIDE out
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1.30
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN30_INSIDE in
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN30_OUTSIDE out
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1.40
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN40_INSIDE in
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN40_OUTSIDE out
```

Remember, access lists work on a "first match" principle, so the order of the rules is important. The 'deny ip any any' statement will deny all traffic that doesn't match the preceding permit statements.

* * *

**You:**

1. The receiving port has an inbound traffic access-list with an ID of ACL_VLAN10_INSIDE. The device checks the packet against the access-list.
2. The packet matches the criteria of the following statement: deny ip any any. The packet is denied and dropped

its blocking packages to itself

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Apologies for the confusion. For inter VLAN communication, the ACLs should be applied to the inbound traffic on the router's sub-interfaces. However, it looks like the access-list applied is denying all traffic as it hits the 'deny ip any any' rule.

For the scenario where you want to allow traffic to and from 8.8.8.8 and also allow devices within the VLAN to communicate with each other, you could modify your access-lists as follows:

```cisco
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_INSIDE
 permit ip host 8.8.8.8 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any
 deny ip any any
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 8.8.8.8
 deny ip any any
```

Repeat these ACL configurations for VLAN 30 as well.

Here's what's happening:

1. The first rule permits IP traffic from 8.8.8.8 to any host in the 192.168.10.0/24 network.
2. The second rule permits IP traffic from any host in the 192.168.10.0/24 network to any destination.
3. Any other traffic that does not match these rules will be denied by the 'deny ip any any' statement.

For VLANs 20 and 40 which do not require internet access, you can permit only intra-VLAN communication:

```cisco
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN20_INSIDE
 permit ip 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255
 deny ip any any
```

Again, remember to apply these access lists to the relevant interfaces in the in or out direction as required:

```cisco
interface GigabitEthernet0/1.10
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN10_INSIDE in
 ip access-group ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE out
...
```

Make sure to replace ... with the appropriate ACLs for the other VLANs. This should ensure inter VLAN communication is working as intended, while also allowing internet access where needed.

**You:**

acl to allow 8.8.8.8 to ping inside the network. currrently ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE is blocking it

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, if you wish to allow 8.8.8.8 to ping inside the network, you will need to modify the ACL\_VLAN10\_OUTSIDE and ACL\_VLAN30\_OUTSIDE access-lists to include a rule for this.

The required rule will permit ICMP packets (which are used for ping) from 8.8.8.8 to the internal network. Here is an example of how you can modify your access-lists:

```cisco
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN10_OUTSIDE
 permit icmp host 8.8.8.8 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 echo-reply
 permit ip 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 host 8.8.8.8
 deny ip any any
```

And for VLAN 30:

```cisco
ip access-list extended ACL_VLAN30_OUTSIDE
 permit icmp host 8.8.8.8 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 echo-reply
 permit ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 host 8.8.8.8
 deny ip any any
```

Remember to reapply these access-lists to the relevant interfaces in the outbound direction.

This modification should allow a ping from 8.8.8.8 to any device in the 192.168.10.0/24 and 192.168.30.0/24 networks.
