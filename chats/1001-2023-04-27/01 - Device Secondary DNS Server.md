* * *

**ChatGPT:**

In Packet Tracer, you can assign a secondary DNS server to a device by following these steps:

1.  Open Packet Tracer and create a network topology with at least two devices connected to each other.
    
2.  Click on the device you want to assign a secondary DNS server to and click on the Config tab.
    
3.  Click on the FastEthernet interface (or any interface that is connected to the network) and then click on the Edit button.
    
4.  In the IP Configuration window, click on the DNS tab.
    
5.  In the DNS tab, enter the primary DNS server's IP address in the Preferred DNS Server field.
    
6.  Enter the secondary DNS server's IP address in the Alternate DNS Server field.
    
7.  Click on the OK button to save the changes.
    
8.  Repeat these steps for any other devices that need a secondary DNS server.
    

Once you have assigned a secondary DNS server to your device, it will use the primary DNS server by default. However, if the primary DNS server is not available, the device will automatically switch to the secondary DNS server.

**ChatGPT:**

The response to your ping command indicates that the server was unable to reach the destination host at 8.8.8.8, which is a public DNS server operated by Google. The response "Destination host unreachable" means that the server was not able to find a route to the destination. The "Request timed out" response means that the server did not receive a response from the destination host.

There could be a number of reasons why the server was not able to reach the destination host, such as:

1.  Network connectivity issues: There may be a problem with the network infrastructure, such as a broken cable, a faulty router, or a misconfigured firewall that is preventing the server from reaching the destination.
    
2.  DNS resolution issues: The server may not be able to resolve the DNS name "8.8.8.8" to an IP address. You could try pinging a hostname, such as "google.com", to see if the server is able to resolve and reach a different destination.
    
3.  Firewall or security settings: The server's firewall or security settings may be blocking the ping requests or the traffic to the destination host.
    
4.  Routing issues: There could be a problem with the routing table on the server or the network infrastructure that is preventing the server from finding a path to the destination host.
    

You may need to troubleshoot the network and check the server's configuration and network settings to identify and resolve the issue.
